# Architecture

envelopeseal is an offline auditor for an envelope encryption key hierarchy. It
reads a text manifest that declares keys and the wrap edges between them, builds
a directed graph from those edges, and answers questions that only make sense at
the graph level. It prints plain text and exits with a status code. It holds no
key material, opens no sockets, and never reads the wall clock.

This document describes the modules that exist under `src/envelopeseal/`, how
data flows between them, and why the boundaries fall where they do.

## The shape of the design

The tool is a pipeline with a single direction of flow:

```
manifest file
  -> manifest.parse_file      (text  -> Manifest)
