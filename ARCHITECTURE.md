# Architecture

envelopeseal is an offline auditor for an envelope encryption key hierarchy. It
reads a text manifest that declares keys and the wrap edges between them, builds
a directed graph from those edges, and answers questions that only make sense at
the graph level. It prints plain text and exits with a status code. It holds no
key material, opens no sockets, and never reads the wall clock.

This document describes the modules that exist under `src/envelopeseal/`, how
data flows between them, and why the boundaries fall where they do.

## The shape of the design

The tool is a pipeline with a single direction of flow:

```
manifest file
  -> manifest.parse_file      (text  -> Manifest)
  -> graph.build_graph        (Manifest -> WrapGraph)
  -> strength / rotation / blast   (pure analysis over Manifest + WrapGraph)
  -> report.collect_findings / render_*   (analysis -> text)
  -> cli.main                 (arguments, exit codes, stdout/stderr)
```

Each stage depends only on the stages above it. `manifest` depends on nothing in
the package. `graph`, `strength`, and `rotation` depend on `manifest` only.
`blast` depends on `graph` and `manifest`. `report` depends on all of the
analysis modules. `cli` sits at the top and depends on everything below. There
are no cycles in the module dependency graph, which mirrors the property the
tool checks for in its input.

## What the tool touches, and what it does not

The tool reads exactly one thing: a manifest file, as UTF-8 text, passed as a
positional argument. It never touches key material. The manifest declares key
ids, roles, algorithm tokens, declared bit sizes, creation dates, and rotation
intervals. It carries no key bytes, no secrets, and no credentials. `manifest`
opens the file, reads it, and closes it. Nothing else in the package performs
IO except `cli`, which writes text to stdout and errors to stderr. There is no
network access, no key management service client, and no environment or clock
read anywhere in the analysis path. The as-of date used by rotation is always
passed in explicitly on the command line, never sampled from the system clock,
so a run is a pure function of its two inputs: the manifest text and the as-of
date.

## Modules

### `manifest.py` — parse the line-oriented key manifest

Owns the input format and nothing else. It defines the immutable `Key` and
`Wrap` records and the `Manifest` container that holds keys keyed by id plus
wrap edges in file order. `parse_text` walks the text line by line; blank lines
and `#` comment lines are skipped, and every other line must be a `key` record
of seven fields or a `wrap` record of three. Parsing is strict: a wrong field
count, an unknown role, a duplicate id, a non-integer size, a negative number,
or a malformed date raises `ManifestError` naming the line number. `parse_file`
is the only place the tool opens the manifest. Keeping the parser standalone,
with no dependency on the graph or analysis code, is what lets every other
module treat a `Manifest` as trusted, well-formed data.

### `graph.py` — the wrap graph and its three operations

The centre of the design. A `WrapGraph` is a directed graph whose nodes are key
ids and whose edges point from a wrapping key down to the key it wraps, so
following edges moves from key encrypting keys toward data keys. It stores
adjacency in both directions (`out_edges` and `in_edges`) so that both
"what does this key wrap" and "what wraps this key" are cheap. `build_graph`
constructs it from a `Manifest` and raises `GraphError` if any wrap edge names a
key id that was never declared. Every traversal sorts neighbours by id before
recursing, so the output is deterministic regardless of the order wrap records
appeared in the file. The three graph operations are described in their own
section below because they are the heart of the tool.

### `strength.py` — algorithm and size ordering, inversion test

Owns the single question "is this key weaker than that one". It maps each key to
one comparable integer, the security level in bits of work. Symmetric algorithms
use their key size directly; modulus based algorithms map their modulus size to
a comparable symmetric level using the NIST SP 800-57 Part 1 Rev 5 Table 2
values. It refuses to guess: an unknown algorithm or an unmapped modulus size
raises `StrengthError` rather than scoring the key as zero, because a silent
wrong number would hide a real inversion. `is_inversion(wrapping, wrapped)` is
true when the wrapping key's level is strictly below the wrapped key's level.

### `rotation.py` — interval and overdue against an as-of date

Owns the rotation calculation. A key with rotation interval 0 is exempt and
never overdue. Otherwise the due date is created plus the interval, and the key
is overdue when the as-of date is strictly after the due date. The as-of date is
always a parameter, never the wall clock, so two runs of the same manifest
against the same date are byte identical.

### `blast.py` — reachable data key counts per key encrypting key

Owns the blast radius calculation, which is the number that changes behaviour:
how many data keys fall if a single key encrypting key is compromised. It uses
the graph's reachability operation. Its output is described in the blast radius
section below.

### `report.py` — collect findings and render every report

The presentation layer. It defines the `Finding` record with a stable code
(`missing-wrap`, `inversion`, `cycle`, `orphan`, `overdue`) so output diffs
cleanly and callers can grep. `collect_findings` runs every check and sorts the
results by `(code, subject)` so order never depends on manifest line order. The
three `render_*` functions turn analysis into the exact text the CLI prints. All
formatting lives here so the analysis modules stay free of presentation.

### `cli.py` — arguments, exit codes, and IO

The top of the pipeline. It defines the `validate`, `blast`, `rotation`, and
`version` subcommands with argparse, maps domain errors to exit code 2, and
chooses the exit code for each command: 0 clean, 1 findings present, 2 usage or
input error. `_load` parses the manifest, builds the graph, and scores every key
once so an unscorable key fails early rather than silently skipping a later
check. `__main__.py` is a thin module entry point so `python -m envelopeseal`
works.

## The three graph operations

The wrap graph is the centre of this design. Three operations run over it, and
each answers a distinct structural question. All three live in `graph.py`.

### 1. Cycle detection

`find_cycles` answers: does any key transitively wrap itself? A wrap cycle means
no key in the loop has a real root, so the hierarchy has no bottom to trust. The
implementation is a depth first search carrying an explicit recursion stack. On
each step it follows the sorted out-edges; if the next node is already on the
current stack, the slice of the stack from that node to the top is a simple
cycle. Each cycle is normalised to start at its lexicographically smallest
member and the set of cycles is sorted, so the same input always yields the same
cycles in the same order. In the broken sample, `loop-a` wraps `loop-b` and
`loop-b` wraps `loop-a`, and the operation reports the single cycle
`["loop-a", "loop-b"]`.

### 2. Reachability under a possible cycle

`reachable_data_keys(graph, start, data_keys)` answers: starting from one key
and following wrap edges downward, which data keys can be reached? This is the
transitive "what does compromising this key expose" question. The critical
property is that it is cycle safe: it carries a visited set and never revisits a
node, so it terminates and returns a finite answer even when the graph contains
a cycle. This matters because the graph is not known to be acyclic at the time
reachability runs; the broken input the tool exists to diagnose is exactly the
input that contains a cycle. Assuming acyclicity here would crash on the input
that most needs analysis. The start key counts toward the result only if it is
itself a data key, matching the idea that compromising a key exposes what it
protects.

### 3. Blast radius calculation

The blast radius calculation, in `blast.py`, builds on reachability. For every
key encrypting key it computes the set of data keys reachable from it, and the
blast radius is the size of that set: the number of data keys that fall if that
one key is compromised. The results are sorted by descending count, then by key
id for a stable tie order, so the widest blast radius is always the first line.
Data keys are not reported here because a data key's blast radius is itself,
which does not help prioritise which key encrypting keys to protect hardest. In
the healthy sample, `root-hsm` reaches all four data keys (blast 4) while each
mid key reaches only its own two (blast 2), which is why the root is the first
key that should move into hardware.

## Why the boundaries fall where they do

The parser is isolated so that every downstream module can trust its input and
never re-validate. The graph is a standalone structure with its own three
operations because the graph is the subject of the whole tool; keeping cycle
detection, reachability, and orphan detection together with the adjacency lists
keeps the traversal invariants (sorted neighbours, deterministic order) in one
place. Strength, rotation, and blast are separate because they answer
independent questions over the same data and share nothing but the `Manifest`
and `WrapGraph`; a change to the strength table cannot affect rotation. The
report layer is the only place that knows the output text, so the analysis
modules can be reused or re-rendered without touching their logic. The CLI is
the only place that performs argument parsing, chooses exit codes, and writes to
streams, so the rest of the package is pure and directly testable, which is what
the unittest suite under `tests/` relies on.
