# Architecture

envelopeseal is an offline auditor for an envelope encryption key hierarchy. It
reads a text manifest that declares keys and the wrap edges between them, builds
a directed graph from those edges, and answers questions that only make sense at
the graph level. It prints plain text and exits with a status code. It holds no
key material, opens no sockets, and never reads the wall clock.

This document describes the modules that exist under `src/envelopeseal/`, how
data flows between them, and why the boundaries fall where they do.

## The shape of the design

The tool is a pipeline with a single direction of flow:

```
manifest file
  -> manifest.parse_file      (text  -> Manifest)
  -> graph.build_graph        (Manifest -> WrapGraph)
  -> strength / rotation / blast   (pure analysis over Manifest + WrapGraph)
  -> report.collect_findings / render_*   (analysis -> text)
  -> cli.main                 (arguments, exit codes, stdout/stderr)
```

Each stage depends only on the stages above it. `manifest` depends on nothing in
the package. `graph`, `strength`, and `rotation` depend on `manifest` only.
`blast` depends on `graph` and `manifest`. `report` depends on all of the
analysis modules. `cli` sits at the top and depends on everything below. There
are no cycles in the module dependency graph, which mirrors the property the
tool checks for in its input.

## What the tool touches, and what it does not

The tool reads exactly one thing: a manifest file, as UTF-8 text, passed as a
positional argument. It never touches key material. The manifest declares key
ids, roles, algorithm tokens, declared bit sizes, creation dates, and rotation
intervals. It carries no key bytes, no secrets, and no credentials. `manifest`
opens the file, reads it, and closes it. Nothing else in the package performs
IO except `cli`, which writes text to stdout and errors to stderr. There is no
